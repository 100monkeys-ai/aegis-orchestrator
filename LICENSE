This Licensed Work will automatically convert to the Apache License, Version 2.0

RATIONALE FOR DEFENSIVE LICENSING

The Business Source License for AEGIS is adopted to prevent exploitation by
hyper-scale cloud providers who would otherwise offer AEGIS as a managed service
without contribution to the ecosystem or commercial agreement. This defensive
posture follows the precedent established by companies like Sentry, CockroachDB,
and other infrastructure providers.

The BSL balances the need for:

1. Open access for individual developers and organizations
2. Protection against predatory appropriation by corporate cloud providers
3. A clear path to true open source (Apache 2.0) in the future
